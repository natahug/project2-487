        <h2>What is Impeachment?</h2>
        <p>
          We're not talking fruits and vegtables.
          <br> <br>The U.S. Consitution permits impeachment as the <br>removal of a holder of public office by the means <br>of a charge of misconduct. 
          <br/> <br> Article II, section 4 states "The President, Vice President<br> and all Civil Officers of the United States, shall be <br>removed from Office on Impeachment for, and <br>Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high <br>Crimes and Misdemeanors."<br> <br> Two U.S. Presidents have been impeached <br>in history, Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton. <br>Neither were convicted by the Senate, <br>or formally removed from office --<br>but how's the Senate involved? <br>How is the House?<br>

        <h2>The House's Role</h2>
        <p>
          
         The House Judiciary Committee first conducts an investigation and recommends articles of impeachment to the full House. "When the full House votes on articles of impeachment, if at least one gets a majority vote, the president is impeached — <br>which is essentially the equivalent of being indicted." (The New York Times) If there is <br>a majority vote, the articles of impeachment move to the Senate, which holds a trial.
          <br/>
          <img class = "flag" src= "../img/flag.png">
          <h2>The Senate's Role</h2>
          <p>
            For the trial, the president has defense lawyers, and the Senate serves as the jury. The Senate holds a vote to convict the president. 

            If at least two-thirds of the senators find the president guilty, they are removed from office. There is no appeal.

          Speaker Nancy Pelosi confirmed that President Trump is being investagted formally by the House. The impeachment inquiry is in response to the dispute over the president's efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate his potential 2020 rival, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.(The New York Times).
          <br>
          <br/>
          As of now, six House committees are continuing to investigate President Trump on impeachable offenses. They will send their strongest cases to the Judiciary Committee, before the full House votes on articles of impeachment. If the House finds the president guilty, the Senate will hold a trial. If the Senate finds him guilty, Trump will be impeached.
