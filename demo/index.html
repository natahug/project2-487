        <h2>What is Impeachment?</h2>
        <p>
          We're not talking fruits and vegtables.
          <br> <br>The U.S. Consitution permits impeachment as the <br>removal of a holder of public office by the means <br>of a charge of misconduct. 
          <br/> <br> Article II, section 4 states "The President, Vice President<br> and all Civil Officers of the United States, shall be <br>removed from Office on Impeachment for, and <br>Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high <br>Crimes and Misdemeanors."<br> <br> <br>The question then, who qualifies such <br>"high Crimes and Misdemeanors"?

        <h2>The House's Role</h2>
        <p>
            In a nutshell: the Contitution give the "power of impeachment" to the Senate, but in order to make it to the Senate, a figure must be found guilty by the House of Representatives.
          <br/> The House Judiciary Committee first conducts an investigation and recommends articles of impeachment to the full House. "When the full House votes on articles of impeachment, if at least one gets a majority vote, the president is impeached â€” which is essentially the equivalent of being indicted." (New York Times) If there is a majority vote, the articles of impeachment move to the Senate, which holds a trial
          <br/>
          <h2>The Senate's Role</h2>
          <p>
          There are no set rules for the Senate's trial, nor are there any requirments set forth in the Consitiution about this process. After the trial, the Senate holds a vote to convict the president. If the vote has a 2/3 or greater majority, the president is removed from Ofice. 
  
          <br/> Only 2 U.S. president have been formally impeached: Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton. Neither of them were convicted by the Senate. Nixon resigned before the impeachment inquiry after the Watergate Scandal, and was never formally impeached, though he would have likely been found guilty by the Senate.
